# sparsevector

![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/anthonyangg/sparsevector/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)

`sparsevector` provides a **sparse numeric vector class (`sparse_numeric`)** and methods for efficient computation with mostly-zero vectors. Operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, crossproduct, sum, norm, and standardization. 

This package is especially useful for handling **high-dimensional vectors** with many zeros while saving memory and computation time.
